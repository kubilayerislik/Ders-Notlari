Country," Living on the road my friend, is gonna keep you free and clean. Now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath is hard as kerosene. You werent your mamas only boy, but her favourite one it seems. She began to cry when you said goodbye, and sank into your dreams.  Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel. He wore his gun outside his pants, for all the honest world to feel. Pancho met his match, you know, on the deserts down in Mexico. Nobody heard his dying words; ah, but thats the way it goes.  All the Federales say, They could have had him any day. They only let him slip away, Out of kindness, I suppose.  Lefty, he cant sing the blues all night long like he used to. The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Leftys mouth. The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio. Where he got the bread to go, there aint nobody knows.  All the Federales say, They could have had him any day. They only let him slip away, Out of kindness, I suppose.  The poets tell how Pancho fell, and Leftys living in cheap hotels. The deserts quiet, Clevelands cold, and so the story ends were told. Pancho needs your prayers its true, but save a few for Lefty too. He only did what he had to do, and now hes growing old.  (All the Federales say, They could have had him any day.) They only let him go so long, Out of kindness, I suppose.  A few grey Federales say They could have had him any day. They only let him go so long, Out of kindness, I suppose. ",WILLIE NELSON & MERLE HAGGARD - PANCHO AND LEFTY LYRICS

Hip-Hop," You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.  1 (Ice Cube) Straight outta Compton Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes. When Im called off I got a sawed off. Squeeze the trigger And bodies are hauled off. You too, boy, if you fuck with me The police are gonna have to come and get me Off your ass. Thats how Im going out For the punk motherfuckers thats showing out Niggaz start to mumble They want to rumble Mix them and cook them in a pot like Gumbo. Going off on a motherfucker like that With a gat thats pointed at your ass. So give it up smooth. Aint no telling when Im down for a jack move. Heres a murder rap to keep ya dancing With a crime record like Charles Manson. AK-47 is the tool. Dont make me act a motherfucking fool. Me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe Im knocking niggaz out the box daily. Yo weekly, monthly, and yearly Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly That Im down with the capital C-P-T. Boy, you cant fuck with me. So when Im in your neighborhood You better duck cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck. As I leave, believe Im stomping  But when I come back, boy  Im coming straight outta Compton.  Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton  2 (MC Ren) Yo Ren! Wassup? Tell em where ya from Straight outta Compton Another crazy ass nigga. More punks I smoke Yo my rep gets bigger. Im a bad motherfucker and you know this But the pussy ass niggaz wont show this. But I dont give a fuck, Imma make my snaps If not from the records, from jacking, or craps. Its like burglary, the definition is jacking Or when illegally armed, its called packing. Shoot a motherfucker in a minute I find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it. So if youre at a show in the front row Imma call you a bitch or a dirty ass ho. Youll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to But that shows me what youre composed to A crazy motherfucker from the street. Attitude legit, cause Im tearing up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic For any dumb motherfucker that starts static. Not the right hand, cause Im the hand itself Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf.  Security is maximum and thats a law. R-E-N spells Ren, but Im raw. See, cause Im the motherfucking villain.  The definition is clear  Youre the witness of a killing Thats taking place without a clue. And once youre on the scope  Your ass is through. Look, you might take it as a trip But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip. Straight outta Compton. Straight outta Compton, Staright outta Compton 3 (Eazy-E) Robin is his name, and the boys commin Straight outta Compton Is a brother thatll smother your mother And make your sister think I love her. Dangerous motherfucker raising hell And if I ever get caught I make bail. See, I dont give a fuck, thats the problem. I see a motherfucking cop, I dont dodge him But Im smart, lay low, creep a while And when I see the punk pass, I smile. To me its kind of funny The attitude is showing Nigga driving But dont know where the fuck he going.  Just rolling Looking for the one they call Eazy But heres the flash: They never seize me. Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark Except when I unload. You see, its fun to jump over a hesitation And hear the scream of the one who caught the lead penetration  Feel a little gust of wind and Im jetting But leave a memory, no one will be forgetting. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her! You think I give a damn about a bitch? I aint a sucker. This is an autobiography of the E And if you ever fuck with me Youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother. Word to the motherfucker. Straight outta Compton. Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton Damn, that shit was dope! ",N.W.A. - STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON LYRICS

Hip-Hop," So, youre a philosopher? Yes, yes, yes, yes I think very deeply I think very deeply, I think very deeply I think, I think, I think very deeply In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak I think very deeply  Lets begin, what, where, why, or when Will all be explained like instructions to a game See Im not insane, in fact, Im kind of rational When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""  This one or that one, the white one or the black one Pick the punk and Ill jump up to attack one KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew Right up to your face and dis you  Everyone saw me on the last album cover Holding a pistol something far from a lover Beside my brother, S C O T T I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me  This is lecture number two, my philosophy Number one, was poetry you know its me This is my philosophy, many artists got to learn Im not flammable, I dont burn  So please stop burnin and learn to earn respect Cause thats just what KR collects See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk You walk down the street and get jumped  You got to have style and learn to be original And everybodys gonna wanna diss you Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx And every sucka MC had a response  You think we care? I know that they are on the tip My posse from the Bronx is thick And were real live, we walk correctly A lot of suckas would like to forget me  But they cant, cause like a champ I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second On the mic, I believe that you should get loose I havent come to tell you I got juice I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level Ill be back, but for now just seckle  [Incomprehensible] In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak  Ill play the nine and you play the target You all know my name so I guess Ill just start it Or should I say, ""Start this,"" I am an artist Of new concepts at their hardest  Cause, yo, Im a teacher and Scott is a scholar It aint about money cause we all make dollars Thats why I walk with my head up When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up  Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games A lot of suckas with colorful names Im so-and-so, Im this, Im that But they all just wick-wick-wack  Im not white or red or black Im brown from the Boogie Down Productions, of course our music be thumpin Others say their bad, but theyre buggin  Let me tell you somethin now about hip hop About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock Ill get a pen, a pencil, a marker Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker  Some MCs be talkin and talkin Tryin to show how black people are walkin But I dont walk this way to portray Or reinforce stereotypes of today  Like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon Talk broken English and drug sellin See Im tellin and teaching real facts The way some act in rap is kind of wack  And it lacks creativity and intelligence But they dont care cause the company is sellin it Its my philosophy on the industry Dont bother dissin me or even wish that wed  Soften, dilute, or commercialize all our lyrics Cause its about time one of yall hear it And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man A vegetarian, no goat or ham  Or chicken or turkey or hamburger Cause to me thats suicide self-murder Let us get back to what we call hip hop And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock  Youre a philosopher? Yes, I think very deeply I think very deeply In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak  How many MCs must get dissed Before somebody says, ""Dont fuck with Kris"" This is just one style, out of many Like a piggy bank, this is one penny  My brothers name is Kenny thats, Kenny Parker My other brother I.C.U. is much darker Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker  Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher Its not about a salary its all about reality Teachers teach and do the world good Kings just rule and most are never understood  If you were to rule or govern a certain industry All inside this room right now would be in misery No one would get along  nor sing a song Cause everyoned be singing for the king, am I wrong?  So yo, whats up, its me again Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend Were criminal minded, an album which is only ten  Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records No more than four minutes and some seconds The competition checks and checks and keeps checkin They take the album, take it home, and start sweatin  Why? well its simple, to them its kind of vital To take KRS-Ones title To them Im like an idol, some type of entity In everybodys rhyme they wanna mention me?  Or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped I dont play around nor do I F around And you can tell by the bodies that are left around  When some clown jumps up to get beat down Broken down to his very last compound See how it sounds? A little unrational A lot of MCs like to use the word dramatical Fresh for 88, you suckas ",BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS - MY PHILOSOPHY LYRICS

Hip-Hop," This here’s a jam for all the fellas Tryin’ to do what those ladies tell us. Get shot down ’cause you’re overzealous, Play hard to get, females get jealous. OK smarty, go to a party, Girls are scantily clad and showin’ body. A chick walks by you wish you could sex her, But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.  Next day’s function, high class luncheon, Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’. Music comes on, people start to dance But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants. A girl starts walkin’, guys start gawkin’, Sits down next to you and starts talkin’. Says she wanna dance ’cause she likes the groove, So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.  (vocal scatting) Just bust a move!  You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’ Someone could cure your lonely condition. Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places, No fine girls, just ugly faces. From frustration, first inclination Is to become a monk and leave the situation. But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope, So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.  New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’ Could care less about the five you’re blowin’ Theatre gets dark just to start the show Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello, Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!” You run over there without a second to lose, And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!) If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it.  In the city, ladies look pretty. Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty. Tell a funny joke just to get some play, Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.” Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’, They want a man who brings home the bacon. Got no money and you got no car, Then you got no woman and there you are.  Some girls are sophistic, materialistic, Looking for a man makes them opportunistic. They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan So that a brother with money can be their man. So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’, Everything you have is yours and not stolen. A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove, So don’t just stand there, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move) If you want it, you got it If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)  (vocal scatting)  Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry, In five days from now he’s gonna marry. He’s hopin’ you can make it there if you can, ‘Cause in the ceremony you’ll be the best man. You say neato, check your libido, And roll to the church in your new tuxedo. The bride walks down just to start the wedding, And there’s one more girl you won’t be getting. So you start thinkin’, then you start blinkin’. A bride maid looks and thinks that you’re winkin’. She thinks you’re kinda cute so she winks back, And now you’re feelin really fine ’cause the girl is stacked. Reception’s jumpin’, bass is pumpin’, Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin’. Says she wants to dance to a different groove. Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move) If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)  (vocal scatting) ",YOUNG MC - BUST A MOVE LYRICS

Hip-Hop," When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn Coz I said to myself look what youve done to her I can feel it inside, I cant explain how it feels All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal  Playing make believe pretending that Im true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amor, kissing you on the ear Whispering I love you and Ill always be here Although I often reminisce I cant believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold And half of me deserves to be this way till Im old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  I need love I need love  Romance sheer delight how sweet I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, well get cozy and huddle Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle Ill give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl youre so sweet Its deja vu whenever Im with you I could go on forever telling you what I do  But where you at youre neither here or there I swear I cant find you anywhere Damn sure you aint in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are, why dont you make yourself seen Take the chance with my love and youll find out what I mean Fantasys can run but they cant hide And when I find you Im gon pour all my love inside  I need love I need love  I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you Grind moan and never be alone If youre not standing next to me youre on the phone Cant you hear it in my voice, I need love bad Ive got money but loves something Ive never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man whos ten feet tall  Id watch the sunrise in your eyes Were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal Youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel Its like a dream land, I cant lie I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something Ill never forget  I need love I need love  See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer A play boy on the run I need something thats stronger Friendship, trust honor respect admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation Its taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand  And understand Ill be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man Im not gonna leave it in destinys hands I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive Ill search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl  I need love I need love  Girl, listen to me When I be sittin in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind And Ive come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen Ill be waiting, I love you ",LL COOL J - I NEED LOVE LYRICS

Yeah, here we go   Once upon a time, not long ago  Where people wore pajamas and lived life slow  Where laws were stern and justice stood  And people were behavin like they ought to good   There lived a little boy who was misled  By another little boy and this is what he said  Me and you Tike, were gonna make some cash  Robbin old folks and makin the dash   They did the job, money came with ease  But one couldnt stop, its like he had a disease  He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother  Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover   The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin erratic  He said, ""Keep still boy, no need for static""  Punched him in his belly and gave him a slap  But little did he know, the little boy was strapped   The kid pulled outta gun, he said, ""Whyd you hit me?""  The barrel was set straight for the cops kidney  The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure  Ill do years if I pull this trigger   So he cold dashed and ran around the block  Cop radios in to another lady cop  He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister  Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her   Looked round good and from expectations  He decided hed head for the subway stations  But she was coming and he made a left  He was running top speed till he was out of breath   Knocked and old man down and swore he killed him  Then he made his move to an abandoned building  Ran up the stairs up to the top floor  Opened up a door, there guess who he saw   Dave, the dope fiend shootin dope  Who dont know the meaning of water nor soap?  He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""  The dope fiend rolled back a spankin shot gun   He went outside but there were cops all over  Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova  Raced up the block doin 83  Crashed into a tree, near university   Escaped alive, though the car was battered  Rat-a-tat-tatered and all the cops scattered  Ran out of bullets and he still had static  Grabbed the pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic   Point it at her head, he said the gun was full of lead  He told the cops, ""Back off or honey heres dead""  Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong  So he let the lady go and he starts to run on   Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded  And before long the boy got surrounded  He dropped his gun so went the glory  And this is the way I have to end this story   He was only one teen in a madmans dream  The cops shot the kid, I still here him scream  This aint funny, so dont ya dare laugh  Just another case about the wrong path  Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast  Goodnight   [Incomprehensible]  I know this story is really weird  [Incomprehensible]  Goodnight ",SLICK RICK - CHILDREN'S STORY LYRICS

And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul She said that the Pro-black was going out of style  She said, Afrocentricity was of the past So she got into R an B, hip house, bass and jazz Now black music is black music and its all good I wasnt salty, she was with the boys in the hood  Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit Just having fun, not worried about anyone And you could tell by how her titties hung  Yes, yes, yall and you dont stop 1, 2, yall and you dont stop Yes, yes, yall and you dont stop 1, 2, Common Sense is gonna drop  I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative But once the man got you, well, he altered her native Told her if she got an image and a gimmick That she could make money and she did it like a dummy  Now I see her in commercials, shes universal She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle Now she be in the burbs licking rock and dressing hip And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city  Talking about popping glocks, serving rocks and hitting switches Now shes a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches Always smoking blunts and getting drunk Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk  Stressing how hardcore and real she is She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz I did her, not just to say that I did it But Im committed but so many niggaz hit it  That shes just not the same, letting all these groupies do her I see niggaz slamming her and taking her to the sewer But Ima take her back hoping that the shit stop Cause who Im talking bout yall is hip hop ",COMMON - I USED TO LOVE H.E.R.

Brothers and sisters keep messin up, why does it have to be so damn tuff? I dont know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull. My grandma past my brothers gone, I never at once felt so alone. I know youre supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire. (Home!) But Lord, I ask you, (Home!) to be my guiding force and truth. (Home!) For some strange reason it had to be, (Home!) he guided me to Tennessee.  (Home!)

Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.  Lord its obvious we got a relationship Talkin to each other every night and day Although youre superior over me We talk to each other in a friendship way Then outta nowhere you tell me to break Outta the country and into more country Past Dyesburg and Ripley Where the ghost of childhood haunts me Walk the roads my forefathers walked Climb the trees my forefathers hung from Ask those trees for all their wisdom They tell me my ears are so young. (Home) Go back, from whence you came (Home) My family tree, my family name (Home) For some strange reason it had to be (Home) He guided me to Tennessee. (Home)  (Home!)

Hip-Hop," PM Dawn Miscellaneous Set Adrift On Memory Bliss The camera pans the cocktail glass,  behind a blind of plastic plants;  I found the lady with the fat diamond ring.  then you know I cant remember a damn thing.  I think its one of those de ja vu things,  or a dream thats tryin to tell me something.  Or will I ever stop thinkin about it.  I dont know, I doubt it.  Subterranean by design,  I wonder what I would find if I met you,  let my eyes caress you,  until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who?  Often wonder what makes her work.  I guess Ill leave that question to the experts,  assuming that there are some out there.  theyre probably alone, solitaire.  I can remember when I caught up  with a pastime intimate friend.  She said, ""Bet youre probably gonna say I look lovely,  but you probably dont think nothin of me.""  She was right, though, I cant lie.  Shes just one of those corners in my mind,  and I just put her right back with the rest.  Thats the way it goes, I guess.   Baby you send me  Set adrift on memory bliss of you   Careless whisper from a careless man,  a neutron dance for a neutron fan;  marionette strings are dangerous things,  I thought of all the trouble they bring.  An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy,  rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh.  Tell me that shes not dreaming.  Shes got an ace in the hole,  it doesnt have meaning.  Reality used to be a friend of mine,  cause complete control, I dont take too kind.  Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on.  Guess whos piece of the cake is Jack gone?  She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign.  I told her whispers in my heart were fine.  what did she think she could do?  I feel for her, I really do.  The next day I had the ring finger on her hand,  I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan,  but I had to put her right back with the rest.  Thats the way it goes, I guess.   Baby you send me...

Hip-Hop," DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince Hes The DJ, Im The Rapper Parents Just Dont Understand You know parents are the same   No matter time nor place   They dont understand that us kids   Are going to make some mistakes   So to you, all the kids all across the land   Theres no need to argue   Parents just dont understand   I remember one year   My mom took me school shopping   It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister   All hopped in the car   We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall   My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose   I didnt say nothing at first   I just turned up my nose   She said, ""Whats wrong? This shirt cost $20""   I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""   The next half hour was the same old thing   My mother buying me clothes from 1963   And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate   I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!   I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, youre ruining my rep""   She said, ""Youre only sixteen, you dont have a rep yet""   I said, ""Mom, lets put these clothes back, please""   She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""   I said, ""This isnt Sha Na Na, come on Mom, Im not Bowzer   Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers   But if you dont want to I can live with that but   You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""   She wasnt moved - everything stayed the same   Inevitably the first day of school came   I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick   But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""   There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax   I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts   And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought   The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought   And those who werent laughing still had a ball   Because they were pointing and whispering   As I walked down the hall   I got home and told my Mom how my day went   She said, ""If they were laughing you dont need the,   ""Cause theyre not good friends""   For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom   That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times   So to you all the kids all across the land   Theres no need to argue   Parents just dont understand   Oh-kay, heres the situation   My parents went away on a weeks vacation and   They left the keys to the brand new Porsche   Would they mind?   Umm, well, of course not   Ill just take it for a little spin   And maybe show it off to a couple of friends   Ill just cruise it around the neighborhood   Well, maybe I shouldnt   Yeah, of course I should   Pay attention, heres the thick of the plot   I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block   Thats when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking   I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking   You shouldve seen this girls bodily dimensions   I honked my horn just to get her attention   She said, ""Was that for me?""   I said, ""Yeah""   She said, ""Why?""   I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""   She said, ""How do I know youre not sick?   You could be some deranged lunatic""   I said, ""Cmon toots - my name is the Prince =   Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""   She agreed and we were on our way   She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word   We hit McDonalds, pulled into the drive   We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes   She kicked her shoes off onto the floor   She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""   She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas   We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast   The sun roof was open , the music was high   And this girls hand was steadily moving up my thigh   She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far   I guess thats why I didnt notice that police car   Were doing ninety in my Moms new Porsche   And to make this long story short - short   When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell   I said, ""I dont have a license but I drive very well, officer""   I almost had a heart attack that day   Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway   I was arrested, the car was impounded   There was no way for me to avoid being grounded   My parents had to come off from vacation to get me   Id rather be in jail than to have my father hit me   My parents walked in   I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""   They didnt speak   I said, ""I want to plead my case""   But my father just shoved me in the car by my face   That was a hard ride home, I dont know how I survived   They took turns -   One would beat me while the other one was driving   I cant believe it, I just made a mistake   Well parents are the same no matter time nor place   So to you all the kids all across the land   Take it from me   Parents just dont understand ",DJ JAZZY JEFF AND THE FRESH PRINCE - PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND LYRICS

Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year (Any time of year) You can find it here  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember, some dance to forget  So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine"" He said, ""We havent had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"" And still those voices are calling from far away, Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...  Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis  Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"" And in the masters chambers, They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives, But they just cant kill the beast  Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before ""Relax, "" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive.

But all the praying just aint helping at all Cause he cant seem to keep his self out of trouble. So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how Another body laying cold in the gutter. Listen to me.  Dont go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to. I know that youre gonna have it your way or nothing at all  But I think youre moving too fast.  Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just cant see. She give him loving that his body cant handle But all he can say is, ""Baby, its good to me."" One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesnt recognize his own face. His health is fading and he doesnt know why.  Three letters took him to his final resting place. Yall dont hear me.  Dont go chasing waterfalls.  Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to. I know that youre gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think youre moving too fast.  Dont go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to. I know that youre gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think youre moving too fast.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to. I know that youre gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think youre moving too fast. Dont go chasing waterfalls.

Pop," Early one mornin the sun was shinin I was layin in bed Wonderin if she changed at all If her hair was still red  Her folks they said our lives together Sure was gonna be rough They never did like Mamas homemade dress Papas bankbook wasnt big enough  And I was standin on the side of the road, rain fallin on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows Ive paid some dues gettin through Tangled up in blue  She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force  We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best  Then she turned around to look at me as I was walkin away I heard her say over my shoulder Well meet again someday on the avenue Tangled up in blue  I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell  So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I was lucky to be employed Workin for a while on a fishin boat Right outside of Delacroix  But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew Tangled up in blue  She was workin in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept lookin at the side of her face In the spotlight so clear  And later on when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same She was standing there in back of my chair Said to me, ""Dont I know your name?""  I muttered somethin underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought youd never say hello,"" she said ""You look like the silent type""  Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century  And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burnin coal Pourin off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air  Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside  And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now Im goin back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know Theyre an illusion to me now  Some are mathematicians Some are carpenters wives Dont know how it all got started I dont know what theyre doin with their lives  But me, Im still on the road headin for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue ",BOB DYLAN - TANGLED UP IN BLUE LYRICS

I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead) All my life I was very deprived I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide  Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (Hachhh-too) I spit when I talk, Ill fuck anything that walks (Cmere) When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits  How you gonna breast feed me, mom? (Wah) You aint got no tits (Wah) I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  Im steamin mad And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?) Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had  Hi, my name is, my name is (What? Who?) My name is Slim Shady Hi, my name is, my name is (Huh? What?)

I mean the macaronis soggy, the peas are mushed And the chicken tastes like wood  So you try to play it off like you think you can By sayin that youre full And then your friend says, ""Momma, hes just being polite He aint finished, uh uh, thats bull!""  So your heart starts pumpin, and you think of a lie And you say that you already ate And your friend says, ""Man, theres plenty of food!"" So you pile some more on your plate  While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin Of the moment that its time to leave And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin Into something that looks like cheese  Oh so, you say, ""Thats it, I got to leave this place I dont care what these people think Im just sittin here makin myself nauseous With this ugly food that stinks!""  So you bust out the door while its still closed Still sick from the food you ate And then you run to the store for quick relief From a bottle of Kaopectate  And then you call your friend two weeks later To see how he has been And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah But were still friends""  With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie The hip hip-a hop-a you dont stop the rockin To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie To the rhythm of the boogie the beat  I say, Hank, can ya rock? Can ya rock to the rhythm that just dont stop? Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo? I said, come on make the, make the people move  I go to the halls and then ring the bell Because I am the man with the clientele And if ya ask me why I rock so well A big bang, I got clientele  And from the time I was only six years old I never forgot what I was told It was the best advice that I ever had It came from my wise dear old dad  He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you And dont say a word until Im through Now, theres a time to laugh, a time to cry A time to live and a time to die  A time to break and a time to chill To act civilized or act real ill But whatever ya do in your lifetime Ynever let a MC steal your rhyme!""  So from sixty-six to this very day Ill always remember what he had to say So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style I let them know that Im versatile  I got style, finesse and a little black book Thats filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look But theres a thing that separates you from me And that is called originality  Because my rhymes are on from what you heard I didnt even bite and not a Goddamn word And I say a little more later on tonight So the sucker MCs can bite all night  A-tick a-tock yall, a-beat beat yall A-lets rock yall, ya dont stop Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?

R&B," (Spoken:) I was born and raised down in Alabama On a farm way back up in the woods I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches Papa used to tease me about it Course deep down inside He was hurt cause hed done all he could  My papa was a great old man I can see him with a shovel in his hand See, education he never had He did wonders when the times got bad The little money from the crops he raised Barely paid the bills we made Oh life had kicked him down to the ground When he tried to get up life would kick him back down One day papa called me to his dyin bed Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said He said ""Patches, Im depending on you son, To pull the family through, My son, its all left up to you""  (Spoken:) Two days later papa passed away And I became a man that day So I told mama I was gonna quit school But she said that was daddys strictest rule  So every morning fore I went to school I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too Sometimes I felt that I couldnt go on I wanted to leave just run away from home But I would remember what my daddy said With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed He said, ""Patches, Im depending on you son I tried to do my best, Its up to you to do the rest""  (Spoken:) Then one day a strong rain came And washed all the crops away And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying The weight of the whole world on my shoulders And you know, mama knew what I was going through, cause  Everyday I had to work the fields Cause thats the only way we got our meals See, I was the oldest of the family And everybody else depended on me Every night I heard my mama pray ""Lord, give him strength to make another day"" Though years have passed and all the kids are grown The angels took mama to a brand new home Lord knows people, I shed a tear My daddys voice helped me through the years Sayin, ""Patches, Im depending on you son, To pull the family through, My son, its all left up to you""  Oh, I could still hear papas voice sayin ""Patches, Im depending on you son, I tried to do my best, Its up to you to do the rest"".  I could still hear papa when hes sayin ""Patches, Im depending on you son, To pull the family through, My son, its all left up to you"" (Fade) ",CLARENCE CARTER - PATCHES LYRICS
